# Swagger Codegen Ignore
# Generated by swagger-codegen https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen

# Use this file to prevent files from being overwritten by the generator.
# The patterns follow closely to .gitignore or .dockerignore.

# As an example, the C# client generator defines ApiClient.cs.
# You can make changes and tell Swagger Codgen to ignore just this file by uncommenting the following line:
# Then explicitly reverse the ignore rule for a single file:

build.gradle
# files which we just don't want to be generated
pom.xml
settings.gradle
build.sbt
gradle.properties   
git_push.sh
gradle/
gradle
gradle/*
gradlew.bat
gradlew
.travis.yml
